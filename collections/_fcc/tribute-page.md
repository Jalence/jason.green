Goal is to create a tribute page that demonstrates basic HTML and CSS skills. Normally students write the tribute for important people of interest, I decided to write about sustainable sushi!  

## User stories
<!-- User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature/requirement told from the perspective of the user or client. 
For FreeCodeCamp, these are also used as tests to determine if the project satisfies the requirements of the assignment.
-->

| 01 | My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding `id="main"`, which contains all other elements.|
| 02 | I should see an element with a corresponding `id="title"`, which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").|
| 03 | I should see a div element with a corresponding `id="img-div"`. |
| 04 | Within the `img-div` element, I should see an img element with a corresponding `id="image"`. |
| 05 | Within the `img-div` element, I should see an element with a corresponding `id="img-caption"` that contains textual content describing the image shown in `img-div`.|
| 06 | I should see an element with a corresponding `id="tribute-info"`, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page. |
| 07 | I should see an a element with a corresponding `id="tribute-link"`, which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. `target="_blank"`). |
| 08 | The `img` element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size. |
| 09 | The `img` element should be centered within its parent element. |
